# Contributing to `flame-llvm`

There are lots of ways for you to help out with making `flame-llvm` successful:

  * Open an issue to report a bug.
  * Write a C# program that compiles to native code using `ecsc` and `flame-llvm`. Open an issue to tell me about it.
  * Fork `flame-llvm`, implement something and send a pull request. Some ideas to get you started:
    1. Implement a BCL API, for example, `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`.
    2. Create a test case for either the compiler or the BCL.
    3. Optimize an already-implemented BCL API.
    4. Implement a compiler feature.

If you'd like to work with `flame-llvm` but you get stuck on something/get confused/don't know what to do, then just drop me an issue. I'd be happy to help you.
